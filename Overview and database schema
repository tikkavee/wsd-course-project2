Overview and database schema
In the second course project, you will build a web application that is used for repeated practice of learned content. The application provides a list of topics and allows creating multiple-choice questions into those topics that are then answered by self and others. The application also shows basic statistics: the total number of available questions and the total number of question answers. In addition, the application also provides an API for retrieving and answering random questions.

The application must use a three-tier architecture (client, server, database) and a layered architecture with four layers (views, controllers, services, database). Furthermore, the application naturally needs to be built using Deno and Oak.

For the project, use the following database schema.
